# 3D-restaurant
It is my Computer Graphics' mini-project. In this I used OpenGL 3.3 to create a 3D view of a restaurant.
## commands
*  Pitch (key X), Yaw (key Y) and Roll (key Z) rotations.
*  Moving forward (key W), backward (key S), left (key A), right (key D), up (key E), and down ( key R) like a flying simulator.
*  Rotating the camera around a look at point using key F.
*  Rotate Fan (key G)
## Prerequisites
Install Visual Studio. Clone this repo. Edit the *include* and *library* with your own path, replace the *glad.c* file with your own. Then simply run.
