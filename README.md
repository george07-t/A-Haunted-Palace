# Haunted Palace 3D Environment

## Project Overview
This project is a 3D simulation of a haunted palace created using OpenGL 3.3, designed to offer a chilling, immersive experience. The environment features a detailed two-floor palace, a curved staircase, massive gates, and eerie furniture, all illuminated with dynamic lighting. The atmosphere is enhanced with a shifting sky and interactive elements, allowing users to control lights, objects, and the camera in real-time.

## Features
- **Haunted Palace Architecture**: Detailed 3D models of a two-floor palace, curved staircases, massive gates, and spooky furniture.
- **Dynamic Lighting System**: Point lights, spotlights, and directional lights create a spooky ambiance. Real-time toggles allow users to control lighting.
- **Interactive Objects**: Gates, windows, and other elements can be controlled with keyboard inputs.
- **Dynamic Sky**: A sky that transitions from day to night, affecting shadows and light intensity.
- **Real-time Camera Control**: Navigate through the environment with intuitive keyboard inputs for movement and rotation.
- **Textures and Materials**: Realistic textures are applied to walls, furniture, and the graveyard, enhancing the overall atmosphere.
